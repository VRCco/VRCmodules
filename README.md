# Simple, Modifiable and Useful Modules

You could say that HTML, CSS, JavaScript and almost *any language* can be separated into modules.

At VRC, we share some of the modules we use on our websites, from news carousels to footers, ideal for easy integration into any project.


## Easy to Add and Modify

VRC Modules has only 3 important steps:

1. Find your module


2. Copy and paste into your favorite code editor

3. Customize and enjoy.

## Easy to Modify

Thanks to annotations, you can know what each line of code does, making it easy to customize it to your needs.

## Use Cases

VRC modules are ideal for both small projects and more complex websites. From a simple homepage to a dynamic website with multiple functionalities.

## Fully Open and Customizable

All VRC modules are open source, meaning you can view the code, modify it, and adapt it to your project without restrictions. The community is welcome to collaborate, improve, and share new ideas.
