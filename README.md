# **Simple, Modifiable, and Useful Modules**  

You could say that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and almost *any language* can be modularized.  

At **VRC Pages**, we share some of the modules we use on our websites—from news carousels to footers—designed for easy integration into any project.  

## **Easy to Use and Customize**  

Using **VRC Modules** is as simple as:  

1. Finding the module you need  
2. Copying and pasting it into your favorite code editor  
3. Customizing it to fit your project  

Each module includes **annotations** explaining its functionality, making modifications effortless.  

## **Perfect for Any Project**  

Whether you're working on a small landing page or a dynamic multi-functional website, **VRC Modules** adapt seamlessly to your needs.  

## **Open Source & Fully Customizable**  

All **VRC Modules** are open source under the **MIT license**, meaning you're free to use, modify, and adapt them as needed. Contributions from the community are always welcome!  

## **Powered by VRC**  

**VRC Modules** is an extension developed by **VRC Pages** and **VRC Supports**, fully compatible with the latest web technologies.
