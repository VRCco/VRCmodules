# Simple, modifiable and useful modules.
- It can be said that HTML, CSS, JavaScript and almost *any language* can be separated into modules.
- That's why at VRC we share with you some of the modules that we use on our websites, from news carousels to a footer.
## Easy to add and modify
- VRC Modules has only 3 important steps: 1. Find your module 2. Copy and paste into your code editor of choice 3. Customize and enjoy.
### Totally easy to change
- Using annotations, you can know what each line of code does.

# This is VRC Modules
- an extension designed by *VRC supports* you and *VRC Pages*.
